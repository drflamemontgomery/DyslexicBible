The Dyslexic Bible
==================

The Dyslexic Bible is an application targeted towards people with dyslexia. It aims to improve the experience for dyslexics so that they can distinguish words from each other.

State of the Project
====================

The Dyslexic Bible application is still heavily in development. Currently the underlying framework, [Zig-UI](https://github.com/drflamemontgomery/zig-ui/), is being actively developed to ensure that similar style applications may use the same framework. This reduces boilerplate and prevents the need to rewrite applications that need the same features.
